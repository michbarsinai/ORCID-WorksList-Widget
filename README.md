# jQuery ORCID Profiles Widget
A jQuery plugin to show the works stored in an ORCID record. A classic use would be to put a list of works  in a faculty web page.

## Requirements
HTML5
jQuery 1.9

## How To
Add a the fields `data-role="orcid-works"` and `data-orcids="your-ORCiD-here"` to a `div`. That `div` will contain your list of works from ORCiD.

See [demo page](demo/index.html) for example.

## What's new

* Support for multiple divs, by changing the detection from `id` to `data-role="orcid-works"`
* Support for loader animation
* More robust loading.
